      <h1>Binangkal Recipe</h1>
      <p>What is Binangkal? Binangkal is a native doughnut from Mindanao and Visayas, but also commonly found in most homegrown neighborhood bakeries or panaderias in the Philippines. It’s especially popular in Cebu as a snack school kids can bring. Unlike most fried and fluffy donuts, binangkal bread is chewy, making it the perfect pair with sesame seeds. The sesame seed’s nutty flavor is released with every bite and chew of the golden brown hard-crisp crust.</p>
      <p>Binangkal gets its name after how these fried spherical donuts are shaped similarly to the fruits of the Nauclea orientalis tree, locally called “bangkal.”  The tree’s fruits are also irregularly round, rough textured, and when partially opened, resembled the cracked part of binangkal.</p>
